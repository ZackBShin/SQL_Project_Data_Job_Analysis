# Background
The motivation behind this project stems from a personal interest in better understanding the current job market in data science, data analytics, and related fields. As someone preparing to enter the workforce, I was inspired to explore where the highest-paying opportunities exist and what specific skills employers are actively seeking. With the rapid growth and evolving demands of the tech industry, it became clear that gaining insight into real-world job postings could provide valuable guidance for shaping my own learning path. By analyzing job data from LinkedIn and Indeed.com, I aimed to identify patterns in compensation, pinpoint the most sought-after tools and technologies, and ultimately determine which skills I should prioritize in order to improve my chances of landing a competitive, high-paying position in the field.

Data hails from YouTuber [Luke Barousse's free course on SQL for Data Analytics.](https://www.lukebarousse.com/sql)

### The 5 questions I wanted to answer through my queries were:

1. What are the top-paying data analyst jobs? 
2. What skills are required for these top-paying data analyst jobs?
3. What are the most in-demand skills for data analyst jobs?
4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn?

# Tools I Used
For my journey delving into the job market, I utilized several key tools:

- **SQL**: for querying and analyzing structured data from the job postings dataset.

- **PostgreSQL**: as the database management system for storing and managing the data.

- **Visual Studio Code**: as the primary code editor for writing and running scripts.

- **Git & GitHub**: for version control and collaboration, tracking changes and managing project development.

# The Analysis

### 1. Top Paying Data Analyst Jobs
To identify the highest paying data analyst jobs, I filtered data analyst positions in the dataset by average yearly salary and location. This query highlights the income opportunity within the field. 

```sql
SELECT
    job_id AS Id,
    job_title AS title,
    job_location AS location,
    job_schedule_type AS schedule,
    salary_year_avg AS salary,
    job_posted_date AS posted_date,
    name AS company_name
FROM job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
    job_location = 'Philadelphia, PA'  AND
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
Here's the breakdown of the top data analyst jobs from 2023:
- **Wide Salary Range**: The top 10 highest paying remote work data analyst roles ranged from $650,000 to $184,000, showing there is significant variability in salary in the field. Running the same query on jobs in my local area of Philadelphia, I saw a much smaller range, of about $180,000 to $90,000 for the top 10 highest paying roles.
- **Diverse employers**: The top 10 remote jobs were comprised of companies in various industries such as internet service providers, security firms, social media, or health insurance companies.
- **Job Title Variety**: There is a high degree of variability in the job titling, from senior data analyst, principal data analyst, or director of analytics.

### 2. The Skills Required for these Jobs
To identify the skills associated with the highest paying data analyst jobs, I first filtered the data into a temporary results table with a CTE with the highest paying jobs, then joined other dimensional tables with information about skills associated with each job listing. Selecting for the information about the related skills, I was able to see which skills were required for these high paying jobs.

```sql
WITH top_paying_jobs AS (
    SELECT
    job_id,
    job_title,
    salary_year_avg,
    name AS company_name
FROM job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
    job_location = 'Anywhere'  AND
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10
)
SELECT top_paying_jobs.*,
        skills_dim.skills
FROM top_paying_jobs
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON skills_job_dim.job_id = top_paying_jobs.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_dim.skill_id = skills_job_dim.skill_id
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC
```
Here's the breakdown of the most common skills among high-paying data analyst jobs:

- **SQL** leading with a bold count of 8.
- **Python** following closely behind with 7.
- **Tableau** is also highly sought after, with other skills such as R, Snowflake, and Pandas sharing slightly lower frequencies.


| Skill     | Frequency | Avg. Salary (USD) |
| --------- | --------- | ----------------- |
| SQL       | 8         | \$207,320         |
| Python    | 7         | \$205,937         |

### 3. What are the most in-demand skills for data analyst jobs?
This query helped to determine the skills that appeared most frequently in all job listings, directing focus for job seekers to skills with the highest prevalence. 

```sql
SELECT 
    skills,
    COUNT(skills_job_dim.job_id) AS demand_count
FROM job_postings_fact
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
WHERE  job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
GROUP BY skills
ORDER BY demand_count DESC
LIMIT 5;
```
Here's a breakdown of the most common sought after skills in the data job market:

- **SQL and Excel are king**, emphasizing the importance of competency in data processing and spreadsheet manipulation.
- Programming and Visualization tools like **Python, Tableau, and Power BI** are essential, showing the need for skills in data storytelling.

| Rank | Skill    | Demand Count |
| ---- | -------- | ------------ |

### 4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries?
This query explores the link between job skills and salary. Here, I looked at which skills in the data set have the highest associated average salaries across all job postings.

```sql
SELECT 
    skills,
    ROUND(AVG(salary_year_avg), 0) AS avg_salary
FROM job_postings_fact
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND 
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY skills
ORDER BY avg_salary DESC
LIMIT 25;
```
Here's a breakdown of the top skills with the highest average salaries:
